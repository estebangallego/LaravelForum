## Review

Released in 1942 and directed by Michael Curtiz, *Casablanca* is often hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the film tells a story of love and resistance in the face of overwhelming odds, anchored by unforgettable performances and an impeccable script.

Humphrey Bogart stars as [Rick Blaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Characters), the jaded owner of Rick’s Café Américain in Casablanca, Morocco. Bogart’s portrayal of Rick, a man hiding his pain and idealism behind a tough exterior, is one of his finest. Opposite him, Ingrid Bergman’s [Ilsa Lund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Characters) is radiant, embodying both vulnerability and strength as a woman caught between her past love and her commitment to her husband, [Victor Laszlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Characters), played by Paul Henreid.

The film’s dialogue is legendary, with nearly every line feeling iconic. From Rick’s bitter musings to Ilsa’s heartfelt pleas, the script is a masterclass in economy and emotional impact. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman sizzles, making their doomed romance all the more poignant.

Max Steiner’s score, featuring the hauntingly beautiful “As Time Goes By,” underscores the film’s themes of nostalgia and loss. The song becomes a motif for Rick and Ilsa’s relationship, adding layers to their already complex dynamic.

The film’s themes of sacrifice and resistance are deeply tied to its historical context, yet they resonate universally. The climax, where Rick makes a selfless choice for the greater good, remains one of the most powerful moments in cinema.
