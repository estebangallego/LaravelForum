## Review

Released in 1993, *Schindler's List* is widely regarded as one of the most important films ever made. Steven Spielberg’s deeply personal and unflinching depiction of the Holocaust is a masterpiece that educates, devastates, and inspires.

The film tells the story of [Oskar Schindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler), a German businessman who initially profits from World War II but gradually transforms into a hero, saving over 1,100 Jewish lives by employing them in his factories. Liam Neeson’s portrayal captures Schindler’s complexity—a man driven by greed who finds his humanity in the face of unimaginable horror.

Ben Kingsley is equally compelling as [Itzhak Stern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzhak_Stern), Schindler’s accountant and moral compass. Ralph Fiennes delivers a chilling performance as [Amon Göth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon_Göth), the brutal Nazi commandant, embodying the banality and monstrosity of evil.

The film’s black-and-white cinematography, by Janusz Kamiński, is both stark and stunning, evoking historical footage while creating a timeless aesthetic. The use of color, particularly the iconic red coat of the little girl, is a poignant and haunting symbol of innocence amidst atrocity.

John Williams’ score, featuring Itzhak Perlman’s haunting violin, is both mournful and transcendent, amplifying the film’s emotional resonance. Spielberg’s decision to film on location in Poland, including Kraków and Auschwitz, lends authenticity to the harrowing story.

*Schindler’s List* does not shy away from the brutality of the Holocaust, but it also highlights acts of courage and humanity. Its final scenes, showing the real survivors and their descendants, serve as a powerful testament to Schindler’s impact and a reminder of the lives that could have been lost.
