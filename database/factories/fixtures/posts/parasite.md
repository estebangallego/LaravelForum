## Review

Released in 2019, Bong Joon-ho’s *Parasite* became an instant cinematic milestone, earning critical acclaim and making history at the Oscars. The film’s biting critique of economic inequality resonates universally, yet its deeply personal storytelling grounds it in human emotion.

The plot follows the [Kim family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)#Cast_and_characters), struggling to escape poverty in South Korea. When an opportunity arises to infiltrate the wealthy [Park family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)#Cast_and_characters) household, the Kims execute a plan that’s as ingenious as it is morally ambiguous. What begins as a darkly comedic satire takes a sharp turn into suspense and tragedy, keeping viewers on edge.

Song Kang-ho’s portrayal of [Kim Ki-taek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)#Cast_and_characters) is nuanced and compelling, capturing the character’s quiet desperation and resigned humor. The rest of the cast, including Cho Yeo-jeong as the naive [Yeon-gyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)#Cast_and_characters) and Park So-dam as the sharp-witted [Ki-jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)#Cast_and_characters), contributes to a layered ensemble that makes the film feel richly textured.

Bong Joon-ho’s direction is impeccable, and the film’s production design is laden with symbolism. The Kim family’s cramped semi-basement home contrasts sharply with the Park family’s expansive, modernist house, visually representing the chasm between their social classes. The repeated use of stairs and vertical spaces underscores the struggle for upward mobility.

The film’s tonal shifts are seamless, reflecting the unpredictable nature of life itself. Its twists are shocking yet earned, culminating in a finale that is both cathartic and harrowing.
